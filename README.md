# 12V DC Motor Speed Controller PCB Design using KiCAD

This project presents a compact, low-cost, and efficient **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** based **DC motor speed controller** using the **NE555 timer IC** in **astable mode**, paired with a power **MOSFET** for driving a 12V DC motor. Designed in **KiCAD**, the circuit is optimized for educational, DIY, and robotics applications. This is a hardware-based controller and does not require software code for its operation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Operational Logic

This circuit controls motor speed by varying the **duty cycle** of a **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** signal generated by the NE555 timer IC operating in **astable mode** (continuous oscillation).

### 1. PWM Generation (NE555):

* The NE555 generates a square wave at Pin 3.
* Frequency and duty cycle are determined by R1 (potentiometer), R2, and C2.
* **T\_H (HIGH time)**: C2 charges through D1, R2, and upper R1.
* **T\_L (LOW time)**: C2 discharges through D2 and lower R1.
* Adjusting the potentiometer changes the ratio of T\_H to T\_L without much change in frequency.

### 2. Motor Driving (MOSFET Q1):

* NE555 output controls the Gate of IRFZ44N.
* When output is HIGH ‚Üí MOSFET ON ‚Üí motor powered.
* When output is LOW ‚Üí MOSFET OFF ‚Üí motor disconnected.
* Rapid switching provides average voltage control proportional to duty cycle.

### 3. Motor Protection (Diode D4):

* SS14 flyback diode prevents damage from back EMF when motor turns off.

## üî£ Timing Equations (Astable Mode with Diodes)

Let R1 be a potentiometer (10k‚Ñ¶), R2 = 1k‚Ñ¶, and C2 = 0.1ŒºF. Let `x` be the wiper position from 0 to 1.

* `R_charge = R2 + x √ó R1`

* `R_discharge = (1 - x) √ó R1`

* `T_H ‚âà 0.693 √ó (R2 + x √ó R1) √ó C2`

* `T_L ‚âà 0.693 √ó (1 - x) √ó R1 √ó C2`

* `T = T_H + T_L`

* `f = 1 / T`

* `Duty Cycle = (T_H / T) √ó 100% = ((R2 + x √ó R1) / (R2 + R1)) √ó 100%`

## üöÄ PWM Motor Speed Control Example

If motor rated speed is 3000 RPM at 12V:

* At 54.5% duty cycle:

`Estimated RPM = 3000 √ó 0.545 = 1635 RPM`

*(Assumes speed is linear with average voltage)*
