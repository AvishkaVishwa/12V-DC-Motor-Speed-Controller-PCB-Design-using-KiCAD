# PWM DC Motor Controller using NE555 Timer

This project demonstrates how to control the speed of a 12V DC motor using a NE555 timer configured as a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator. The circuit uses an N-channel MOSFET (IRFZ44N) to handle the motor's current, and a potentiometer is used to adjust the motor speed by varying the duty cycle of the PWM signal.

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) based motor speed controller** using a **NE555 timer IC** and an **IRFZ44N N-channel MOSFET**. By varying the duty cycle of the PWM signal using a potentiometer, the speed of a **12V DC motor** can be precisely controlled. The flyback diode (1N4001) is used to protect the circuit from back EMF generated by the motor when switching.

## 4. How It Works
The **NE555 timer** is configured in **astable mode** to generate a continuous PWM signal. The frequency of the signal is set to **20 kHz**, and the duty cycle (which determines the motor speed) is adjustable using a potentiometer. The PWM signal from the NE555 drives the gate of the **IRFZ44N MOSFET**, which switches the motor on and off very quickly. By changing the duty cycle, you adjust the time the motor is on during each cycle, thus controlling its speed.

## 5. Working Principles

### PWM Control:
PWM is a method of reducing the average power delivered by the motor by rapidly switching the power on and off. The speed of the motor is proportional to the duty cycle of the PWM signal:
- **Higher Duty Cycle** = Higher Speed (More ON time)
- **Lower Duty Cycle** = Lower Speed (Less ON time)

### NE555 Timer in Astable Mode:
- The NE555 timer generates a square wave at a specific frequency, which is controlled by resistors **R1**, **R2**, and capacitor **C1**.
- The output at **Pin 3** provides the PWM signal to the **MOSFET gate**.

## 6. Steps to Build

### Step 1: Setup the NE555 Timer
1. Connect **Pin 1** (GND) to ground.
2. Connect **Pin 8** (VCC) to the 12V power supply.
3. Connect **Pin 4** (Reset) to VCC to keep the timer active.
4. Connect **Pin 3** (Output) to the **gate** of the MOSFET.
5. Connect a **potentiometer** between **Pin 7** (Discharge) and VCC. The wiper of the potentiometer is connected to **Pin 7** to control the duty cycle.
6. Connect **R1 (1.2 kΩ)** between **Pin 7** and VCC.
7. Connect **R2 (3 kΩ)** between **Pin 6** (Threshold) and **Pin 7**.
8. Connect **C1 (10nF)** between **Pin 6** and ground.

### Step 2: MOSFET and Motor Connections
1. Connect the **drain** of the MOSFET to one terminal of the motor.
2. Connect the **source** of the MOSFET to ground.
3. Connect the other terminal of the motor to the 12V supply.
4. Place the **1N4001 diode** across the motor terminals, with the **anode** connected to the motor's negative side and the **cathode** to the positive side (to protect against back EMF).

### Step 3: Power Supply and Bypass Capacitor
1. Place the **100 μF capacitor** between the 12V power supply and ground for noise filtering.
2. Power up the circuit and adjust the potentiometer to vary the motor speed.

## 7. Frequency and Resistor Calculations

### Frequency Calculation:
<img src="/Images/formula.png">
With R1 = 1.2 kΩ, R2 = 3 kΩ, and C1 = 10 nF, the calculated frequency is approximately **20 kHz**, which is suitable for motor speed control without causing audible noise.

## 8. Future Improvements
Here are some potential future enhancements:
- **Feedback Control:** Adding feedback from the motor to adjust speed more precisely using a tachometer sensor.
- **Microcontroller Control:** Replacing the NE555 timer with a microcontroller (such as an Arduino) for finer control and to add features like motor direction control, braking, or remote control.
- **Higher Voltage/Current Control:** Using a different MOSFET or driver for controlling higher-powered motors.
