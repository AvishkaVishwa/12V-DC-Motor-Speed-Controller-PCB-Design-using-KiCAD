## ⚙️ Circuit Operational Logic

This circuit controls motor speed by varying the **duty cycle** of a **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** signal generated by the NE555 timer IC operating in **astable mode** (continuous oscillation).

### 1. PWM Generation (NE555):

* The NE555 generates a square wave at Pin 3.
* Frequency and duty cycle are determined by R1 (potentiometer), R2, and C2.
* **T\_H (HIGH time)**: C2 charges through D1, R2, and upper R1.
* **T\_L (LOW time)**: C2 discharges through D2 and lower R1.
* Adjusting the potentiometer changes the ratio of T\_H to T\_L without much change in frequency.

### 2. Motor Driving (MOSFET Q1):

* NE555 output controls the Gate of IRFZ44N.
* When output is HIGH → MOSFET ON → motor powered.
* When output is LOW → MOSFET OFF → motor disconnected.
* Rapid switching provides average voltage control proportional to duty cycle.

### 3. Motor Protection (Diode D4):

* SS14 flyback diode prevents damage from back EMF when motor turns off.

## 🔣 Timing Equations (Astable Mode with Diodes)

Let R1 be a potentiometer (10kΩ), R2 = 1kΩ, and C2 = 0.1μF. Let `x` be the wiper position from 0 to 1.

* `R_charge = R2 + x × R1`

* `R_discharge = (1 - x) × R1`

* `T_H ≈ 0.693 × (R2 + x × R1) × C2`

* `T_L ≈ 0.693 × (1 - x) × R1 × C2`

* `T = T_H + T_L`

* `f = 1 / T`

* `Duty Cycle = (T_H / T) × 100% = ((R2 + x × R1) / (R2 + R1)) × 100%`

### Example:

* R1 = 10kΩ, R2 = 1kΩ, C2 = 0.1μF, x = 0.5
* T\_H = 0.693 × 6kΩ × 0.1μF ≈ 0.4158 ms
* T\_L = 0.693 × 5kΩ × 0.1μF ≈ 0.3465 ms
* Total Period ≈ 0.7623 ms → Frequency ≈ 1312 Hz
* Duty Cycle ≈ 54.5%

## 🚀 PWM Motor Speed Control Example

If motor rated speed is 3000 RPM at 12V:

* At 54.5% duty cycle:

`Estimated RPM = 3000 × 0.545 = 1635 RPM`

*(Assumes speed is linear with average voltage)*

## ⚠️ Suggestions for Improvement

* Use **IRLZ44N** for logic-level gate drive (if using 3.3V/5V control)
* Add a **10kΩ pull-down** resistor to MOSFET Gate to ensure turn-off
* Add **0.1μF decoupling capacitor** close to NE555 power pins
* Use heatsink for MOSFET if motor current >2A
* Add reverse polarity protection at input (e.g., diode or P-MOS)
